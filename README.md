# Welcome to NextJS Demo!

## Next.js Demo App

In this project, weâ€™ll build a scalable web application using Next.js.
This is a project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

- ðŸ“– [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## ðŸš€ Key Takeaways

- Introduction to Next.js and its benefits
- App is a dashboard with list of events and guests who have shared their RSVPs.
- Database is done with Turso through Drizzle-kit

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Docker

Once Docker is running, run `docker image ls` to see what you have locally
Type `docker image rm <image name>` to remove any that you don't want sticking around if you need to free up space.
